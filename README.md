# üéÆ GamEd: A Gamified 3D Physics Learning Application

## üìò Project Overview
**GamEd** is an interactive educational platform designed to revolutionize the way physics concepts are taught and understood. By combining the power of real-time simulations with gamified learning, **GamEd** offers users the ability to visualize, interact with, and manipulate fundamental physics principles in an engaging and intuitive manner.

The platform leverages **Unity Engine** for high-quality visualization and dynamic physics simulations, enabling users to explore topics such as **projectiles, collisions (1D), magnetism, logic gates, incline motion,** and **uniform circular motion (pendulums)**. With features like **customizable parameters, real-time feedback**, and **hands-on experimentation**, GamEd bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical understanding.

Its **modular design** supports tailored learning experiences, catering to a wide range of learners‚Äîfrom students and educators to lifelong enthusiasts. By transforming complex physics topics into interactive challenges and simulations, **GamEd** aims to make physics education both accessible and enjoyable.
